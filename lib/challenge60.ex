     (**) Construct height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes
    Consider a height-balanced binary tree of height H. What is the maximum number of nodes it can contain?
    Clearly, MAXN = 2**H - 1. However, what is the minimum number MINN? This question is more difficult.
    Try to find a recursive statement and turn it into a function minnodes defined as follows:

    (min-nodes H) returns the minimum number of nodes in a height-balanced binary tree of height H.


    On the other hand, we might ask: what is the maximum height H a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes can have?
    (max-height N) returns the maximum height of a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes

    Now, we can attack the main problem: construct all the height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.
    (hbal-tree-nodes N) returns all height-balanced binary trees with N nodes.

    Find out how many height-balanced trees exist for N = 15.
